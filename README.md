## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the best learnings was the deploy, I've never doing that before and I'm really proud of it. Ommiting that, I learned how to use media queries properly and was a funny stuff for me. Nothing relevant on it but it was so funny.

### Continued development

I want to go further on media queries, because it's a core tool in responsive design.
